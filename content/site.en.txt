About:

<p>Architecture Land Initiative (ALIN) is a cooperative based in Geneva and Zürich (Switzerland). ALIN is a non-profit common-benefit platform.</p>
<p>We believe that architecture, landscape architecture and urbanism must strive for new and inclusive planning processes supporting the transformation and re-construction of our milieus. We seek to address the systemic challenges posed by the current climate crisis, rapid urbanisation and the threat of ecosystem collapse.</p>
<p>By bringing together a changing number of contributors with shared values and work ethos, ALIN, as a collective generates projects for the land and the city as architectures of contribution that foster space for life, with an expanded vision of creating and sharing values.</p>
<p>Our vision is embedded in trans-scalarity, from a temporal and territorial perspectives, with the aim of unveiling human and non-human affordances for a social and ecological transition. Our initiatives and collaborations range from the intimate scale, such as punctual cultural and popular events, to the large scale involving urban and territorial transformations.</p>
<p>The platform operates as a flexible infrastructure. It consists of a cooperative legal framework, a communication structure enabling collective work, a series of studios, as well as a set of tools and expertise consolidated in practice and made available to all. Its members – both practitioners and researchers – are connected to various research and teaching institutions in Switzerland and internationally (Zurich University, EPFL, Hong Kong University).</p>
